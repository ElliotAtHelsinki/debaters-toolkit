Debaters' toolkit is a helpful online toolkit for debaters. Users can search for or generate random debate motions based on various criteria (e.g. tournament, topic, language, etc.), calculate break for BP, AP, and WSDC, and do time keeping for various debate formats without having to download any software. This software contains open-source third-party materials used in full accordance with related licenses and intellectual property laws.

## Installation

Visit elliotathelsinki.github.io/debaters-toolkit and add the app to your homescreen. You can also run the native version of the app on `Linux` using the `AppImage` file in [release](https://github.com/ElliotAtHelsinki/debaters-toolkit/releases/tag/v0.0.0). There used to be executables for `Android` and `Windows` as well, but they were no longer available after the project was migrated to this current repository. Those executables can be manually built, if necessary.

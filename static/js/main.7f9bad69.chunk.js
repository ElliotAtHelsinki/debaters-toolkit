illustrating the Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter x Hunter series, which have sold over 100 million copies in Japan to date. Since 2006, Togashi has become infamous for taking numerous lengthy hiatuses while creating HxH. This was due to several factors, such as illness and lower back pain, but it is also speculated that his slow output is because he is a perfectionist that wants to do everything himself.

He was orphaned as a child as his dragon father mysteriously disappeared.  After being orphaned, he joins the wizard guild Fairy Tale and grows up there.  Fairy Tale has taken in other children, such as Lisanna, as well, and they grow up together as each other\'s family.  Natsu and Lisanna are shown to be extraordinarily close as children, and it is heavily implied there was mutual romantic interest.  Lisanna however disappears one day in a magical accident as a pre-teen and is presumed dead.  Years later, Natsu meets Lucy on an adventure and she joins the guild.  Lucy becomes one of the main characters, goes on many adventures with Natsu, and they become extraordinarily close.  On one adventure, the main cast discovers Lisanna in an alternative universe and brings her back to the guild.  Lisanna as both a pre-teen and adult is shown to have moderate magical strength. Although he does reconnect with Lisanna as friends, in the show Natsu is shown to continue to prioritize his friendship with Lucy.

On the day they reach adulthood, every citizen is taken into the citadel, to a room in the basement. There, in the deepest dungeon, they find a child, malnourished and sick, chained against the wall, in the utmost misery a human being can endure. They know that if the child were comforted, if it were allowed to enjoy a solitary moment of happiness, that the beauty of the city above would crumble, and disease, crime and want would become a part of the peoples lives. For that reason, the child will never be allowed to leave by the city. Every citizen in Omelas knows it is there, and they have all agreed to live with it. Occasionally, a citizen, man or woman, young or old, will walk through the gate on the edge of the city. They will venture into the desert that surrounds the city for as far as can be seen, walk over the horizon, and never be seen or heard from again.They are known only as The Ones who Walk Away from Omelas.

Only designated permanent residents of J&K could own property, obtain government jobs in the state, receive govt. scholarships, etc. In late 2019, the Government of India placed major political leaders under house arrest, revoked its special status, and partitioned the state into two territories that the Government of India has direct and complete control over.

Hero Academia universe. He is driven by a desire to surpass the #1 hero, All Might, who is much stronger than him. This all-encompassing desire leads him to be a rude hero to fans, as well as a terrible father, being both largely absent and prioritizing raising strong hero children over love or care when present. This causes severe emotional and psychological abuse to both his wife and children, which damages his children and leads his wife to have a psychotic break. Over the course of the series, Endeavor is shown to come to regret his decisions and the show frames this as a redemption arc. He seeks atonement from his children, who are unwilling to provide it. He vows to become a father they might be proud of one day. We are provided flashbacks from the perspectives of other heros that attempt to humanize Endeavor, showing him to for example work harder than anyone else at unseen parts of hero work such as disaster cleanup. His wife reveals that Endeavor visits her often (from afar) and sends her flowers in the psych ward. In the last episode of the most recent season, Endeavor very nearly dies fighting a dangerous villain, and is shown to be concerned with being a morally good hero, father role model, and fan role model in order to fill All Might\'s role now that he has retired in the moments before risking his life and right after. The show provides us clips of his family seeming to start to change their minds on their perspective of him, and fans who formerly felt cast aside by Endeavor having rekindled their love for him. Endeavor now replaces All Might in a key moment of the show\'s opening sequence in the currently premiering season.","content":"THO the redemption arc of Endeavor.","link":"","tournamentID":"Z9WBfg1yDJgSR34BGYp1","division":"","round":"Grand Final","topic":{},"id":"eOb7CvRLUKKcIuGmt8XH"},{"division":"","round":"2","link":"","tournamentID":"x0mst3SfcsgMKKZ3eg7G","content":"TH would impose a cap on the amount of money parents are allowed to spend on their children (excluding essential healthcare and disability needs).","infoSlide":"","topic":{},"language":"English","id":"ePGofklOAQcl9sKayTNI"},{"content":"Ch\xfang t\xf4i v\u1edbi t\u01b0 c\xe1ch l\xe0 l\xe3nh \u0111\u1ea1o t\xf4n gi\xe1o, s\u1ebd t\xedch c\u1ef1c truy\u1ec1n b\xe1 quan ni\u1ec7m r\u1eb1ng nh\u1eefng ng\u01b0\u1eddi v\xf4 th\u1ea7n v\u1eabn c\xf3 th\u1ec3 l\xean thi\xean \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng.","infoSlide":"","topic":{"religion":{"check":true,"title":"Religion"}},"link":"","division":"","language":"English","round":"","tournamentID":"CJKUeBIUibEtZYahoUQV","id":"eQ4WUzz1yg4QF4ek0sBg"},{"topic":{},"link":"","tournamentID":"NyCp19C1AzxXzCUQLio8","round":"Open_Semis","content":"Should buildings that have been empty/unused for over a year be made freely available for general use?.","division":"","language":"English","infoSlide":"","id":"eQAf9vY0ZSua1kKsSlEt"},{"tournamentID":"D9jVXR7QB0BrNFTW3MDz","content":"THW obligate newly formed states that were formed through violent resistance to pay reparations for harms and casualties which were caused by their struggle.","round":"Open_Final","topic":{},"language":"English","link":"","division":"","infoSlide":"","id":"eQSiovZ11d725ChI3ajI"},{"topic":{},"infoSlide":"","language":"English","link":"","content":"This house supports the establishment of zero rating platforms in the developing world.","round":"2","tournamentID":"AbrZ6leGJBXAmv4md2Zw","division":"","id":"eQjgE4ooVY8FEYvYCuVh"},{"round":"2","infoSlide":"","content":"THW impose quotas that ensure at least half of a company\u2019s board of directors is composed of women.","topic":{},"language":"English","link":"","tournamentID":"AsoDjVHcLSyKMQmLkB7S","division":"","id":"eQnIsAimFgWBh5Wi0Bxc"},{"topic":{},"content":"Setting aside infectious diseases, THW work to prevent interaction with tribes who have not had contact with the modern world.","language":"English","infoSlide":"","division":"","tournamentID":"HlR3H86XBK4mqvL9v5HT","round":"4","link":"","id":"eQyt5HNNxmgt5FML1hhB"},{"topic":{},"link":"","round":"Open_Semis","division":"","infoSlide":"","content":"THR that cultural identities and practices are primarily bound to racial heritage- Semi Final 2.","language":"English","tournamentID":"nXN2yUG7soxwCp4xidzj","id":"eRi2CZU42XLNGBhSw2HJ"},{"language":"English","content":"That we support Moon Jae-In\'s attempts to reform The Supreme Prosecutors\' Office of the Republic of Korea.","link":"","division":"","topic":{},"round":"Open_Semi","infoSlide":"","tournamentID":"1bHNYzF6GWRqdpr3f5vt","id":"eRolAORwMzZkKzbmKMR0"},{"round":"Open_Quarters","content":"THW implement TCDS on all criminals convicted of violent crimes.","division":"","topic":{},"infoSlide":"","language":"English","tournamentID":"Z9FMqY7i0SmIcw5xUsUL","link":"","id":"eSHjVfUQzyUVdjCugKQo"},{"division":"","tournamentID":"1dwGdjAn9pODo8bQfmJW","language":"English","link":"","infoSlide":"Gray-zone warfare is a tactic designed to degrade opposition\'s attrition by constantly forcing them to stay in a high state of alert (ex. scrambling fighter jets and having them fly just outside the border ex. sailing ships just outside naval territorial boundaries).

This peer-to-peer verification keeps the information very secure, but also results in an extremely high electricity consumption to maintain the networks (currently estimated at over 130 Terawatt hours in a year, or 0.6% of global electricity consumption). A basic purpose of Blockchain is to be able to assign a unique identity to a tradeable piece of digital information, preventing attempts to alter or replicate it (because the peer-to-peer verification system mentioned above would detect such violations). A core use of Blockchain is cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherium, which are able to function as a decentralized currency without a central bank or government\u2019s control. The blockchain is used to store a ledger of transactions on each coin, and the verification system keeps in place an artificial scarcity that prevents more from being \\"printed out.\\" Some other

In limited contexts, the latest versions of the advanced language generating technology were found to be indistinguishable from human writing, however the technology as a whole is still error-prone.
